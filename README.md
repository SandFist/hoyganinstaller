# hoyganinstaller
Easy FiveM Server Installer for Linux.
I made this script to automate FiveM Server Installation and Updating in any Linux machine.

It downloads actually latest build for Linux and extracts it to "~/server/" (Home Directory).

Should **work out of the box** in almost **any Linux Distribution**, if not make sure you have
## the following requirements:
  - **git**
  - **tar**
  - **wget**
  - **curl**
  - **grep**

## Instructions:
  - Clone or **download the repository** to your server
```
  git clone https://github.com/feelfreetofee/hoyganinstaller/
  cd hoyganinstaller
```
  - Give execute flag to the file and run it
```
  chmod +x hinstaller.sh
  ./hinstaller.sh
```

~~See? It's easy as getting AIDs in a music festival!~~
