# hoyganinstaller
Easy FiveM Server Installer for Linux.
I made this script to automate FiveM Server Installation and Updating in any Linux machine.

It downloads actually latest build for Linux and extracts it to "~/server/" (Home Directory).

Once done, it runs the server for first init configuration.

**·** Should **work out of the box** in almost **any Linux Distribution**, if not make sure you have the following requirements:
  - **git**               (Only needed if you want to "git clone" instead of downloading from browser)
  - **tar**               (May be not included in your dist)
  - **wget**              (Same as above)
  - **curl**              (You're not running linux, wtf)
  - **grep**              (Are you even running any Unix-Like?)
  - **root** privileges?  (Ask for support to any adult near)

**·** Instructions:
  - **git clone https://github.com/feelfreetofee/hoyganinstaller/** or just download the repository to your server
  - **cd hoyganinstaller**
  - **chmod +x hinstaller.sh**
  - **./hinstaller.sh**

See? It's easy as getting aids in a music festival!
