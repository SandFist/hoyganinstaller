Easy FiveM Server Installer for Linux.
I made this script to automate FiveM Server Installation and Updating in any Linux machine.

It downloads actually latest build for Linux and extracts it to "~/server/" (Home Directory).
Once done, it runs the server for first init configuration.

**Â·** Should **work out of the box** in almost **any Linux Distribution**, if not make sure you have the following requirements:
  - tar               (May be not included in your dist)
  - wget              (Same as above)
  - curl              (You're not running linux, wtf)
  - grep              (Are you even running any Unix-Like?)
  - root privileges?  (Ask for support to any adult near)
